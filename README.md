in a scatter plot.

Works appropriately for 
1. Clustered regualar datasets
2. Randomized datasets

Steps to run this application :
1. Download the Apache Commons Maths library from 
http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/download_math.cgi 

2. Extract the same in your destined Java Project folder.

3. Go to the Netbeans IDE and in the Libraries submenu under Tools,
click on 'New Library' button and then give it a proper name and
